# IMM-Filter
Interacting multiple model (IMM) filter for object tracking. The interacting multiple model filter is designed to tracking objects that are highly maneuverable. Use the filter to predict the future location of an object, to reduce noise in the detected location, or help associate multiple object detections with their tracks.
